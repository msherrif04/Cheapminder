# CHEAP.MINDER [Revisit Your Favourite Book Hightlights](https://www.cheapminder.herokuapp.com)

This is my first big project, built mainly for me to use as a personal alternative to readwise as well as test and showcase my front end and back end skills. This is very much a **personal project and nothing else**

## Tech stack chosen

For the front end, I used figma in designing the website. I used vanilla css and html as well bootstrap for the front end design. The neomorphism was done using [neomorphism generator](https://neumorphism.io).

I chose flask for backend development and the postgresql for managing the database for this web app.

## How to use

1. The app contains some of my favourite highlights which can be viewed by everyone

2. Everyone is welcome to add their favourite highlights either manually using the 'New Highlight' section

3. Highlights can also be added via a csv file. The csv file should have 3 columns in the following order; quote, author, book

4. There is an option to add your email, this will allow you to receive a random highlight via email daily

**Enjoy resurfacing your favourite highlihgts**
